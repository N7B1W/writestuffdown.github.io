As I grow older I find that I have an increasing appreciation for the simpler things in life.  Could this be a result of wisdom gained, a result of my own reduced physical fortitude, or something else?

Sitting on my porch in the worn, repainted wicker furniture, already flaking, creaking and groaning from supporting my body, I feel a relaxation I no longer feel in front of a computer or television.

The porch provides shade from the sun, I close my eyes and take in a deep breath of the crisp fresh air.  It tastes fresh and crisp, not recycled, stuffy or stale like air inside can sometimes feel and taste.  I feel the cool air brushing against my skin.  The wind is not strong or driving, rather it gently teases my skin like a feather.

The sound of the wind comes to me augmented by the various players sharing the outdoor world with me today.  The tree which sits in front of the porch, protecting me from the harsh sun and providing me with some privacy from my neighbor rustles, moving with the wind.  The sound relays the movement of the tree in the wind.  In the distance dogs bark and children should in excited play, muted by distance and wind but adding to the tapestry of the background noise.

I feel the same calm descend upon me that I have felt in alone in the woods in this more accessible location.  I am not alone in my enjoyment of this environment.  My dog rolls around in the grass on his back for no apparent reasons other than the sheer enjoyment of being outside.

As a child, I was always outside.  The rule was simple, stay within shouting distance from our house.  Leave that auditory ring and I was inviting danger and disaster should I *not* be able to hear my Mother calling. It was the standard rather than the exception that our society seems to embrace today.

We live in a world that is more connected than ever.  Kids have phones, these phones have GPS tracking, there is no reason a parent could not know where their child is always, yet we feel more comfortable with them inside that outside enjoying unstructured play.  

Why does it seem like we would be more comfortable with our children being inside than out?  Clearly our children live more structured lives today than we ever did.  Just look at your calendar and you can easily see how little Johnny's week is scheduled.  Does unstructured activity feel like wasted opportunity? Or does the unfettered freedom that letting our children go out and play make us nervous?  

I think this may be the root of the problem more than anything else.  As parents, we want to protect our children from the wolves.  And with the Internet, we see daily the types of wolves in the public that were far less *visible* when we were kids.  And yet, according to a 2012 article in the <a href="http://wcfcourier.com/news/evansdale_search/statistics-on-missing-children-daunting/article_22ac5beb-378a-5bc6-b662-124e042c51a6.html">Courier</a> the boogeyman/woman only accounts for 2% of total missing children with 8% being attributed to being children wandering off and becoming lost.  So, unless you live on the edge of a national forest, why not encourage kids to go play outside?

I take a sip of my glass of ice water sitting on the wicker table beside me.  I can feel the cold eddies of water snake their way down into my stomach.  My toes almost reflexively clench and unclench the concrete beneath my feet.  The little pebbles and ridges left over from when the mason poured the porch ten years ago caress my toes.  I think about the possum I saw run under the concrete porch a few weeks ago and I wonder where it has gone.  

But mostly I just close my eyes and enjoy how relaxing this ten minutes outside has made me feel.
